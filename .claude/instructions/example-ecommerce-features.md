### Multi-Dimensional Conflict Analysis
This complex e-commerce task set demonstrates advanced conflict resolution:
- **Database schema conflicts** - Auto-merges product table changes (Confidence: 8.5+)
- **API endpoint overlaps** - Selects optimal routing strategies (Confidence: 7.0+)
- **React hook conflicts** - Merges state management approaches (Confidence: 6.8+)
- **Analytics calculation conflicts** - Preserves accuracy in metrics (Confidence: 8.2+)

### Code Quality Intelligence
- **Performance pattern detection** - Identifies efficient query patterns and caching strategies
- **Security analysis** - Validates payment processing and data protection compliance
- **Architectural consistency** - Maintains separation of concerns across services
- **Testing completeness** - Ensures comprehensive coverage of critical e-commerce flows

### Learning System Examples
- **E-commerce patterns** - Learns project-specific patterns like cart management and checkout flows
- **Performance preferences** - Adapts to preferred optimization techniques
- **UI consistency** - Maintains design system compliance across components
- **API design patterns** - Follows established RESTful conventions

### Real-World Conflict Scenarios
1. **Product schema evolution** - Multiple workers extending product models
2. **Shopping cart state management** - Different approaches to cart persistence
3. **Analytics calculation methods** - Varying implementations of revenue metrics
4. **Component prop interfaces** - Different type definitions for shared components

*This example demonstrates the system's ability to handle complex, interconnected features with minimal manual conflict resolution.*
