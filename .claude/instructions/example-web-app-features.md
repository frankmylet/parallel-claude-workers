# Task Set: Modern Web Application Features

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive set of modern web application features including authentication, dashboard, and API integration. This demonstrates typical parallel development tasks for a full-stack web application.

**‚ö° Conflict Resolution Showcase**: This task set is designed to demonstrate the full power of intelligent conflict resolution across authentication, UI components, and API layers.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Authentication System
- Create LoginForm component with email/password validation
- Implement SignupForm with user registration flow
- Add PasswordReset functionality with email verification
- Create AuthGuard component for protected routes
- Implement JWT token management and refresh logic
- Add social login integration (Google, GitHub)
- Create comprehensive authentication tests
- Write security tests for auth vulnerabilities

### Task 2: Dashboard and Analytics
- Create Dashboard component with widget system
- Implement MetricsCard components for key statistics
- Add InteractiveCharts using Chart.js or similar
- Create UserActivityFeed showing recent actions
- Implement NotificationCenter for system alerts
- Add RealTimeUpdates using WebSocket connections
- Create responsive design for mobile devices
- Write performance tests for dashboard loading

### Task 3: API Integration and Data Management
- Design RESTful API endpoints for all features
- Implement DataService layer with error handling
- Add CacheManager for optimizing API calls
- Create FormValidation system with custom rules
- Implement FileUpload with progress tracking
- Add SearchAndFilter functionality across data
- Create DataExport features (CSV, PDF, Excel)
- Write comprehensive API integration tests

## ‚ö° Comprehensive Conflict Resolution Demo

### Full-Stack Conflict Scenarios
This task set creates realistic conflict scenarios across the entire application stack:

#### Frontend Conflicts (Auto-Resolution Confidence: 7.5-9.0)
- **React component interfaces** - Different prop definitions for auth components
- **State management approaches** - Various implementations of user state
- **Routing configurations** - Different protected route implementations
- **Styling conflicts** - Multiple approaches to dashboard styling

#### Backend Conflicts (Auto-Resolution Confidence: 8.0-9.5)
- **API endpoint definitions** - Different HTTP methods and parameters
- **Middleware implementations** - Various authentication and validation approaches
- **Database schema changes** - User table modifications and indexing
- **Service layer patterns** - Different error handling and data transformation approaches

#### Configuration Conflicts (Auto-Resolution Confidence: 9.0+)
- **Package.json dependencies** - Different version requirements
- **Environment variables** - Various configuration approaches
- **Build configurations** - Different bundling and optimization settings
- **Testing configurations** - Multiple testing framework setups

### Advanced AI Features Demonstrated

#### üîç **Multi-Layer Analysis**
- **Security pattern validation** - Ensures auth implementations follow security best practices
- **Performance optimization detection** - Identifies efficient data fetching and caching patterns
- **Accessibility compliance** - Validates component accessibility standards
- **Testing coverage analysis** - Ensures comprehensive test coverage across features

#### üéØ **Intelligent Decision Making**
- **Implementation quality scoring** - Selects better code based on complexity, maintainability, and performance
- **Architectural consistency** - Maintains consistent patterns across the application
- **Best practice adherence** - Enforces coding standards and framework conventions
- **Error handling robustness** - Prioritizes implementations with better error handling

#### üìä **Learning and Adaptation**
- **Pattern recognition** - Learns preferred authentication flows and UI patterns
- **Performance preferences** - Adapts to preferred optimization techniques
- **Code style consistency** - Maintains consistent formatting and naming conventions
- **Testing strategy alignment** - Follows established testing patterns and coverage requirements

### Real-World Conflict Examples

#### High-Confidence Auto-Resolution (8.5-9.5)
```typescript
// Conflict: Different API endpoint exports
// Worker 1: export { authApi }
// Worker 2: export { userApi, authApi }
// Resolution: Merge exports intelligently
export { authApi, userApi, dashboardApi }
```

#### Medium-Confidence Resolution (6.5-7.5)
```typescript
// Conflict: Different auth hook implementations  
// System selects implementation with better error handling
// and loading states based on quality analysis
```

#### Learning System Example
- **Project Pattern**: Prefers Redux Toolkit over Context API
- **Adaptation**: Future auth state conflicts favor Redux implementations
- **Confidence Boost**: Similar conflicts get higher auto-resolution confidence

*This comprehensive example demonstrates how the system handles complex, real-world development scenarios with minimal manual intervention while maintaining code quality and architectural consistency.*
