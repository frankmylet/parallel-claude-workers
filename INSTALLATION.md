# Installation Guide

## Quick Installation

*Install the complete AI-powered parallel development system with intelligent conflict resolution*

### Method 1: Copy to Any Project

```bash
# Copy the parallel-claude-workers directory to your project
cp -r /path/to/parallel-claude-workers /your/project/root/
cd /your/project/root

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/*.sh

# Test installation
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --help
```

## Setup for Claude Code Integration

### Add Enhanced Slash Commands

To use `/parallel-work`, `/format-tasks`, and `/resolve-conflicts` commands in Claude Code:

```bash
# Create symlinks in your project's .claude/commands/ directory
cd /your/project/root

# Create .claude/commands directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Create symlinks to all parallel tools
ln -s ../../parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh .claude/commands/parallel-work
ln -s ../../parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/task-formatter.sh .claude/commands/format-tasks
ln -s ../../parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/conflict-resolver.sh .claude/commands/resolve-conflicts
ln -s ../../parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/intelligent-task-splitter.sh .claude/commands/split-tasks
ln -s ../../parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/advanced-code-analyzer.sh .claude/commands/analyze-code
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Test all enhanced functionality
.claude/commands/parallel-work --help
.claude/commands/format-tasks --help
.claude/commands/resolve-conflicts --help
.claude/commands/split-tasks --help

## Configuration

### Customize AI-Powered Features

1. **Configure conflict resolution**:
   ```bash
   # Customize conflict resolution behavior
   cp parallel-claude-workers/.claude/config/resolver-settings.json my-resolver-config.json
   # Adjust confidence thresholds, strategies, and learning parameters
   ```

2. **Edit task templates**:
   ```bash
   # Customize the task template for your project type
   cp parallel-claude-workers/.claude/instructions/template.md my-project-template.md
   # Edit my-project-template.md with project-specific guidelines
   ```

3. **Create project-specific examples**:
   ```bash
   # Create examples relevant to your project
   cp parallel-claude-workers/.claude/instructions/example-user-profile.md my-project-tasks.md
   # Edit with your actual project tasks
   ```

4. **Adjust default settings**:
   ```bash
   # Edit parallel-manager.sh if needed
   nano parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh
   # Modify WORKER_COUNT, BRANCH_PREFIX, etc.
   ```

5. **Tune code analysis**:
   ```bash
   # Configure quality analysis weights and metrics
   nano parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/advanced-code-analyzer.sh
   # Adjust architectural, performance, and security analysis parameters
   ```

## Verification

### Test the Complete AI-Enhanced Workflow

```bash
# 1. Test intelligent task splitting
echo "- Create login component
- Add user dashboard  
- Build admin panel
- Implement user authentication
- Add data analytics" > test-notes.txt

parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/task-formatter.sh --input=test-notes.txt --workers=3
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/intelligent-task-splitter.sh split --input=parallel-tasks.md --workers=3

# 2. Test parallel development with conflict resolution
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --instructions=parallel-tasks.md --workers=3 --auto-launch

# 3. Test AI conflict resolution
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/conflict-resolver.sh analyze --detailed
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/conflict-resolver.sh resolve --strategy=auto --confidence=8.0

# 4. Test code quality analysis
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/advanced-code-analyzer.sh analyze --worktree=all --detailed

# 5. Test review and cleanup
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --review
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --merge
parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --cleanup
```

## Troubleshooting Installation

### Permission Issues

```bash
# Fix script permissions
chmod +x parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/*.sh
```

### Path Issues

```bash
# Use absolute paths if relative paths don't work
/full/path/to/parallel-claude-workers/.claude/workflows/parallel-manager.sh --help
```

### Git Issues

```bash
# Ensure you're in a git repository
git status

# Initialize git if needed
git init
```

### VS Code Issues

```bash
# Ensure VS Code command is available
code --version

# Install VS Code command if missing
# (Instructions vary by OS)
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Remove parallel development system
rm -rf parallel-claude-workers/

# Remove all symlinks
rm .claude/commands/parallel-work
rm .claude/commands/format-tasks
rm .claude/commands/resolve-conflicts
rm .claude/commands/split-tasks
rm .claude/commands/analyze-code

# Clean up any remaining worktrees
rm -rf worktrees/
```

## Next Steps
